This project focuses on answering the above main question as well as the
sub-questions stated. I have used different datasets to produce the relevant
visualisations in order to be able to see trends and patterns throughout the
years and identify the answer to our main question. In order to do that I first
answered the sub-questions and then proceeded using literature reviews and
statistical methods to answer the main question.
